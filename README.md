# Interview_ALA_data_analyst
 
This technical task is part of the interview and is to test if you could produce a visualisation of using data on reptiles in the ACT, using data available via the ALA. 

The following instrcutions are from the email from Dr Martin Westgate:

 
1. The visualisation can be static or dynamic, and can be presented alone (jpg, png, pdf etc) or within a document rendered using markdown or similar (html, pdf, word etc)
2. Any programming language is fine (R, Python, JS, Juliaâ€¦)
3. The visualisation should be made available via a Github repo (or equivalent); please reply with a link to the repository in question prior to your interview time
4. You should emphasise an aspect of the data that you find to be most informative or interesting; this can involve filtering to a subset of the full dataset if you prefer
